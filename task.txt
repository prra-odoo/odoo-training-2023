1: On a website, create a menu called 'Properties' that will list "available" properties (which are yet to be sold and not cancelled/archived) in a grid. To go extra miles: 
    1.1 - -Add image to the property, and display it on front-end as well
    1.2 - Add a pager (single page will display maximum of 10 properties)

2: Clicking on particular property from grid, open a beautiful dedicated page for that property (imagination is your best friend, use it to make your page eye-catching and mobile friendly).
Note: don't hesitate to go through bootstrap documentation - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/ to benefit from available classes / components / utilities.

3: In the grid (on the top of the page), add one date-picker, which will allow you to select date, and a button next to it (named 'Listed After'). This will allow you to filter the properties that are created after the selected date, in descending order.
